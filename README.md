Here is 52636!

You ask why is my name so strange? Well, it's just because it defeated me when I thought of my name, and '526364' is my general nick name. When I wanted to use it, I found that  
it has been used by another user...

I am a college student in China, who love to play Genshin and Phigros. I come to Github just because I loved to. I'm a simple person having a simple life, and it really fancinated  
me.I am not a good programmer, and I can only use Python and C++ to program. Here in the Github, I can have more chances to learn from others. 

Now except for working for my test, I'm also working to build a Star Rail(another game developed by mihoyo, who developed Genshin) battle system to practise my programming. To be  
honist, it's rather hard to a freshman. I'm not good at C++, so my working folder is full of .py files. Although! I just want to try my best. I'll not upload it at present until I  
get the database permission(so if there is anyone who can help me with the database problem, please contact me).
