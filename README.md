# Introduction
Yoo~

Here is 52636!

You ask why is my name so strange? Well, it's just because it defeated me when I thought of my name, and **526364** is my general nick name. When I wanted to use it, I found that  it has been used by another user...

I am a college student in China, who love to play Genshin, Phigros and WOWS. I come to Github just because I want to further develop my programming abilities. I'm a simple person having a simple life, but I want something exciting. I am not a good programmer, and I only learned Python and C++ to program(even the Markdown is what I just learned). Here in the Github, I can have more chances to learn from others. 

Now except for working for my test, I'm also working to build a Star Rail(another game developed by mihoyo, who developed Genshin) battle system to practise my programming. To be honist, it's rather hard to a freshman. I'm not good at C++, so my working folder is full of .py files. Although! I just want to try my best. I'll not upload it at present until I get the database permission(so if there is anyone who can help me with the database problem, please contact me).

Welcome to come to play with me!

# 简介

哟吼~

这里是52636！至于用这个名字的原因嘛，我不太想费心思起名字，原本想用**526364**（我的游戏昵称），只不过被别人占用了……

我是一名大学生，闲来喜欢玩原神，Phigros和战舰世界。来Github主要是想锻炼自己的编程能力（主要是刷力扣太没意思了，感觉没法真正锻炼自己）。我的生活很纯粹，但是我想找点好玩的东西。我编程水平不太行，只会Python和C++（甚至Markdown语言都是我才学的）。在Github，我可以从这里大佬的代码中学到很多。

除了忙于学业，我还在写一个星穹铁道的战斗系统。说实话，就我的编程能力，这真的很困难。我不擅长C++，所以我工作目录下都是.py文件。但即使是这样，我也想尽自己的最大努力。由于数据库的原因，我还不会上传到这里（要是有大佬能帮我请一定联系我！！）

欢迎大家没事来找我一起玩！
